This project relies on http://disguise.one software to function.

For the plugin setup process - please see https://help.disguise.one/Content/Configuring/RenderStream-r18.htm

Please note that from version 1.26 onwards, the plugin has been renamed from "disguiseuerenderstream" to "RenderStream-UE". Existing Unreal projects will need to be updated to reflect this.
